This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle bug in PHP related to object references and modifications within functions.  The bug arises from PHP's pass-by-reference behavior for objects, leading to unintended side effects when a function returns a modified object without creating a copy. The solution illustrates how to use cloning to create a true copy, preventing unexpected changes to the original object.
